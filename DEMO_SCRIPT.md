## SCRIPT

### INTRO [0:00 - 0:20]

*[Screen: Landing page hero section]*

**Brian:**
"Hello there, my name is Brian Mwai. This is my submission for the AI Partner Catalyst Hackathon.

I built Sparrow AI because I watched too many sales reps lose deals they should have won. Not because they didn't know the theory, but because they never had a safe place to practice.

Sparrow lets you practice sales calls with AI prospects that push back like real buyers. Let me show you how it works."

### PLATFORM WALKTHROUGH [0:20 - 0:55]

*[Screen: Click "Start Practicing Free" > Sign in > Dashboard]*

**Brian:**
"After signing in, you land on your dashboard. You can see your total calls, average score, and practice streak.

From here, you pick a practice mode. Cold calls for booking meetings. Discovery for uncovering pain. Or the Objection Gauntlet for handling pushback."

*[Screen: Click "Cold Call" > Persona configuration]*

**Brian:**
"Now I configure my AI prospect. I'll pick a VP of Operations in SaaS, give her a skeptical personality, and set the difficulty to hard.

Behind the scenes, Gemini 2.0 Flash generates a complete persona with a backstory, hidden pain points, and specific objections she'll throw at me."

*[Screen: Show pre-call briefing with prospect details]*

**Brian:**
"Before the call, I get a briefing. Sarah Chen, VP of Ops at a logistics company. My goal is to book a 30-minute demo. She's going to push back on timing and budget. Let's see if I can handle it."

### LIVE CALL DEMONSTRATION [0:55 - 2:10]

*[Screen: Click "Start Call" > Live call interface with waveform]*

**Brian:**
"The voice experience is powered by ElevenLabs Conversational AI. Following Thor's recommendation from the judging panel, I explored the Voice Design Best Practices documentation to create a natural, low-latency conversation. The AI responds in real-time with under 500 milliseconds of latency."

*[Call begins - Sarah speaks first]*

**SARAH (AI):**
"This is Sarah."

**BRIAN:**
"Hi Sarah, this is Brian with Sparrow. I know I'm calling out of the blue. Do you have 30 seconds?"

**SARAH (AI):**
"I'm actually pretty busy right now. What's this about?"

**BRIAN:**
"Fair enough. I'll be quick. I work with operations leaders who are struggling with delivery delays eating into their margins. Is that something you're dealing with, or am I off base?"

**SARAH (AI):**
"We've had some issues, but we just implemented a new system last year. We're not really looking at anything new right now."

**BRIAN:**
"I hear you. Sounds like you went through a lot of change recently. Out of curiosity, has that new system actually solved the delay problem, or are you still seeing issues?"

**SARAH (AI):**
"Honestly? It helped with some things, but we're still getting complaints from customers about late shipments. It's frustrating."

**BRIAN:**
"That is frustrating. When shipments are late, what does that actually cost you? Lost customers? Penalty fees?"

**SARAH (AI):**
"Both. We've lost two accounts this quarter because of it."

**BRIAN:**
"Two accounts is significant. Look, I don't want to take more of your time right now, but I'd love to show you how companies like yours have cut delivery delays by 40% without ripping out what you just built. Would Thursday at 2pm work for a quick 20-minute call?"

**SARAH (AI):**
"Thursday at 2 works. Send me a calendar invite."

**BRIAN:**
"Done. Thanks Sarah, talk Thursday."

### DEBRIEF & SCORING [2:10 - 2:45]

*[Screen: Loading screen "Analyzing your call..." > Debrief page]*

**Brian:**
"After the call, Groq provides instant scoring in under two seconds. Then Gemini runs a deeper analysis for detailed feedback.

I scored 7.8 out of 10. Strong opening because I earned attention quickly. Discovery was solid because I dug into the cost of her problem. And I closed with a specific time, which is why she said yes.

But look at this. At 0:45, she mentioned delivery delays and I could have asked about the impact sooner. That's the kind of specific, actionable feedback that actually makes you better."

### CLOSING [2:45 - 3:00]

*[Screen: Progress dashboard showing skill breakdown]*

**Brian:**
"Every call is tracked. You can see your skills improve over time. Opening, discovery, objection handling, call control, closing.

Sparrow AI. Built with ElevenLabs Conversational AI, Google Gemini, and Groq. So you never have to wing a call again.

Thank you for watching."

## CALL SCRIPT BREAKDOWN (For Practice)

The demo call is designed to showcase:

| Moment | Skill Demonstrated | Why It Impresses |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| "Do you have 30 seconds?" | Permission-based opener | Shows respect, earns attention |
| "Is that something you're dealing with?" | Hypothesis-led question | Shows preparation, invites conversation |
| "Has that new system actually solved..." | Dig deeper on status quo | Uncovers hidden pain |
| "What does that actually cost you?" | Quantify the problem | Shows business acumen |
| "Without ripping out what you just built" | Handle objection preemptively | Shows listening |
| "Thursday at 2pm" | Specific close | Confident, clear next step |

The AI's responses show:
- **Personality consistency:** Stays skeptical but opens up when asked good questions
- **Realistic objections:** "We just implemented something" is common
- **Natural conversation:** Interrupts, gives short answers, sounds human
