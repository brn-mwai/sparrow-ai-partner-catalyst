## THE SCRIPT

### ACT 1: The Problem (0:00 - 0:25)
*[VISUAL: Dark screen, then fade into someone at a desk looking defeated]*

**VOICEOVER:**

"Okay, confession time.

My first sales call? I called the VP of Operations at a Fortune 500 company... and I called her 'sir.'

*[pause]*

Yeah. That happened.

But here's the thing — every salesperson has a story like this. We've all bombed calls. Forgot our pitch. Said 'um' forty-seven times. Asked a question they literally just answered.

And where did we practice? On real prospects. Real deals. Real money walking out the door.

That's insane when you think about it."

---

### ACT 2: The Solution (0:25 - 0:40)
*[VISUAL: Sparrow logo appears, then dashboard]*

**VOICEOVER:**

"So we built Sparrow.

It's an AI sparring partner for salespeople. You practice conversations with AI prospects that actually push back — like real buyers do.

No scripts. No roleplay with your manager who's checking Slack the whole time. Just you, your voice, and an AI that doesn't let you off easy.

Let me show you."

### ACT 3: The Demo (0:40 - 1:35)
*[VISUAL: Screen recording of actual product flow]*

**VOICEOVER:**

"Here's how it works.

*[Click 'Start Practice']*

I pick my scenario — let's do a cold call. Now I configure my prospect.

*[Select options]*

Industry: SaaS. Role: VP of Operations. Personality: Skeptical. Difficulty: Hard.

*[Generate persona]*

Sparrow generates a complete persona using Google's Gemini. Meet Sarah Chen — VP of Ops at a logistics company, eight months in the role, skeptical of new vendors.

*[Show briefing card]*

I even get intel: her likely objections, what might trigger interest, and what to avoid.

*[Click 'Start Call' — show live call interface]*

Now I talk. Out loud. Like a real call.

*[Show waveform animation, brief snippet of conversation]*

The AI responds in real-time using ElevenLabs' voice technology. It's not reading a script — it's actually having a conversation with me. It pushes back. It says 'we're not interested.' It makes me work for it.

*[End call — show analyzing screen]*

When I'm done, Sparrow analyzes everything.

*[Show debrief/scorecard]*

I get scores across five dimensions — opening, discovery, objection handling, call control, and closing.

But here's the magic part...

*[Show timestamped feedback]*

It shows me exactly where I messed up. Timestamp: one minute twelve seconds — 'She mentioned delivery delays. You didn't dig in. Try asking: how much is that costing you per month?'

That's not generic advice. That's coaching on my actual words."

---

### ACT 4: The Impact (1:35 - 1:50)
*[VISUAL: Progress charts, then back to human element]*

**VOICEOVER:**

"The more you practice, the better you get. Sparrow tracks your progress over time — your strengths, your weak spots, your streak.

Sales teams spend months ramping new reps. Sixty-seven percent of salespeople miss quota. Not because they don't know the product — because they don't know how to have the conversation.

Sparrow fixes that."

---

### ACT 5: The Close (1:50 - 2:00)
*[VISUAL: Logo + tagline]*

**VOICEOVER:**

"Practice on AI. Perform on humans.

Sparrow. Never wing a call again."

*[END]*

## ALTERNATIVE SHORTER VERSION (90 seconds)

If 2 minutes feels too long, cut Act 1 to:

> "Every salesperson has bombed a call. And where did we practice? On real prospects. Real deals. That's insane. So we built Sparrow."

This saves ~15 seconds.
