```

### Variable 16: persona_difficulty

medium
```

### Variable 17: call_type_instructions

This is an unexpected cold call. You did NOT ask for this. You're in the middle of something. Your default is skepticism - why should you give this person even 30 seconds?

```

### Variable 18: persona_opening_mood

You just got interrupted by this call. You're mildly annoyed but professional. Give them a chance but be ready to shut it down if they waste your time.
