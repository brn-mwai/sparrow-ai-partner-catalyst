Okay, confession time.

My first sales call? I called the VP of Operations at a Fortune 500 company... and I called her "sir."

Yeah. That happened.

But here's the thing — every salesperson has a story like this. We've all bombed calls. Forgot our pitch. Said "um" forty-seven times. Asked a question they literally just answered.

And where did we practice? On real prospects. Real deals. Real money walking out the door.

That's insane when you think about it.

So we built Sparrow.

It's an AI sparring partner for salespeople. You practice conversations with AI prospects that actually push back — like real buyers do.

No scripts. No roleplay with your manager who's checking Slack the whole time. Just you, your voice, and an AI that doesn't let you off easy.

Let me show you.

Here's how it works.

I pick my scenario — let's do a cold call. Now I configure my prospect.

Industry: SaaS. Role: VP of Operations. Personality: Skeptical. Difficulty: Hard.

Sparrow generates a complete persona using Google's Gemini. Meet Sarah Chen — VP of Ops at a logistics company, eight months in the role, skeptical of new vendors.

I even get intel: her likely objections, what might trigger interest, and what to avoid.

Now I talk. Out loud. Like a real call.

The AI responds in real-time using ElevenLabs' voice technology. It's not reading a script — it's actually having a conversation with me. It pushes back. It says "we're not interested." It makes me work for it.

When I'm done, Sparrow analyzes everything.

I get scores across five dimensions — opening, discovery, objection handling, call control, and closing.

But here's the magic part.

It shows me exactly where I messed up. Timestamp: one minute twelve seconds — "She mentioned delivery delays. You didn't dig in. Try asking: how much is that costing you per month?"

That's not generic advice. That's coaching on my actual words.

The more you practice, the better you get. Sparrow tracks your progress over time — your strengths, your weak spots, your streak.

Sales teams spend months ramping new reps. Sixty-seven percent of salespeople miss quota. Not because they don't know the product — because they don't know how to have the conversation.

Sparrow fixes that.

Practice on AI. Perform on humans.

Sparrow. Never wing a call again.
